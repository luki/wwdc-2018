Today is the start of a new month, and I’m very thankful for WWDC, because my strong desire of wanting to go there motivated me to keep working on one project, to have a final product that would be educational and fun to look at. I must admit, I was frustrated quite a few times, because I thought I wouldn’t finish in time or just couldn’t figure out a solution, but eventually found that solution or a work-around that was satisfactory.

One more thing: Happy 41th Anniversary today, Apple. And a happy easter to everyone at the company!
