Beyond WWDC, I have participated in two hackathons. At Jugend hackt 2016 in Berlin, where the team I was in worked on a demonstration organizing platform called DaDaDemo. I’ve taught three girls some HTML code and showed one of the girls some basic Swift. More interesting was the Jugend hackt event in Tokyo in 2017. Together with 4 mentors and a half (the last wasn’t actually a mentor, but a team member of Jugend hackt) and four others, I travelled to Tokyo for a week. The whole weekend was spent with German-learning groups all over from Asia in a hackathon. I was in a group with a German mentor and two Chinese girls. One of the two girls owned a Macbook, so I taught her basics of Swift and together, we worked out an iOS app, for which the two girls designed the interface for the most part (https://github.com/jugendhackt/eureka-ios). Furthermore, I’ve applied for Jugend hackt Cologne 2018 and am considering to become a mentor for future events once I’m 18.
More interesting for how I share knowledge might be my YouTube channel(s) and my blog. My current personal channel only has one video explaining how binary trees work with an example in the functional programming language Haskell (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07KyFS7FQsI&t=531s). However, on my ‘old’ YouTube channel, I have a lot of videos about Xcode, iOS, Swift and also other programming languages such as Go and Rust (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7oLrDPxvGG_FLJy2U5P5w/).
Lastly, I write articles as well, such as this one one my current blog (http://lukasam.com) about Haskell’s list pattern and how to imitate it in Swift (http://lukasam.com/programming/haskell/swift/2018/02/04/imitating-haskells-list-pattern.html).  Some other articles are on Medium.com, such as this one about how to make an app similar to a simplified Pokemon Go (https://medium.com/@betaluki/how-to-make-pokemon-go-for-ios-part-1-map-locationin-this-article-series-we-are-going-to-code-58d0c7fe0961).
I love sharing new discoveries, may they built upon knowledge I already had or are completely new. Usually, I make videos on very basic and general topics, and write articles on more specific topics. These two media are my favorite way of sharing knowledge, in real life, however, I enjoy teaching people too. Some students in my Computer Science class at school are rather new to the subject, so I try to show them a trick or two.
